# Dev-ES Conf 2017

Slides and notebooks for my talk in Dev-ES Conf 2017, about Machine Learning.

To run the notebooks, you will need install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), so clone this repo and inside it run the following command:

```
docker run -it \
           -v $(PWD):/notebooks \
           -p 8888:8888 \
           petronetto/machine-learning-alpine
```
